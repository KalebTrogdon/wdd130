    <h2>Stevie</h2>
    <p>I am getting my degree in software engineering; I used to have a career in HVAC but after a motorcycle wreck with a drunk driver that left me with a broken left leg and pelvis. <br>
    The doctors told me I could no longer work my old job due to problems that will arise.</p>
    <p>I love motorcycles even though I almost lost my life on one, although I most likely won’t ride again there is a feeling that comes with riding them that you can’t find normally. <br>
    Body building is my main passion as I grew up overweight and not in good health, I found that bodybuilding has saved me from my medical problems. I used to be type 2 diabetic<br>
    but now, I have it under control due to dieting and exercise. Unfortunately, I had to give it up due to the accident but I recently got the ok to go back to doing it but to stay away from certain lifts.
