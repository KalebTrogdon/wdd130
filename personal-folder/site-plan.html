        We are the leading company in using nanotechnology in humans to eradicate diseases. We have been working to bring the best and most affordable technology. We believe that no one should have to suffer because of illness. People suffer and die every day to simple diseases and parasites and we want to reduce that number to no one. We are hoping to bring this technology to third world countries and treat those less fortunate to better health. While we know this is a huge undertaking, we believe that life is worth saving no matter who they are.

      <h3>Q&A</h3>
      <p>
        Common Questions that are asked of us are; is what your doing possible? Is this safe? Is this ethical? And some answers to these hard questions are; Yes, this is very possible, only a short time ago we were able to drop nanotech into oils spills to contain and eat the oil thus saving the marine life. If we set the parameters of the machines to eat specific formations of atoms or specific chemical makeups, we could stop cancer or even the common cold. Yes, it is safe we have tested extensively on test animals with zero problems and are now in the midst of human trials through volunteers. We have been able to get rid of cancer cells that were growing and even myxomatosis in rabbits. The simple answer to is it ethical is yes. We believe in upholding morals and values as a company and that is why even though we used testing animals to test the technology we believed that this was the only possibility to bring us the ability to stop horrendous diseases in humans. None of the test subjects that were used would have survived if left untreated.
