      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Providing those who are sick a chance at a new life. We are building a company that is planning to make sickness a thing of the past. We hope you 
        will consider us for your next device that will save your life. Providing those who are sick a new chance at life. We hope you will consider us for your next device that will save your life. We are an ambitious startup company with dedicated personal 
        with a personal investment in the success of this device. The company was made with a dream of making life easier and more enjoyable for everyone. Many of those here 
        have family members or friends who are suffering and want to make this dream a reality. We hope you will join us in this journey to providing everyone the opportunity 
        to become whole and live their best life. We hope to eradicate disease that have plagued humanity since the dawn of time. We hope to be what penicillin was to bacteria 
        and completely suppress all illnesses. We know this is a long and arduous goal and we hope as you support us, we will come to save as many lives as we can. 
        For the future of humanity and for your family’s future we hope to provide you and the rest of human kind with a peaceful existence. </p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>Cancer? blood clots? We are here to make those a thing of the past. Our technology allows the user to get rid of such things with this small device you can wear. 
        With nanoparticles we can encapsulate or otherwise help to deliver medication directly to cancer cells and minimize the risk of damage to healthy tissue. 
        This has the potential to change the way doctors treat cancer and dramatically reduce the toxic effects of chemotherapy. 
        We are going to grow complex tissues with the goal of one day growing human organs for transplant. Nanotechnology can improve vaccines, including vaccine delivery without the use of needles. 
        We are working to create a universal vaccine scaffold for the annual flu vaccine that would cover more strains and require fewer resources to develop each year. 
        We hope to break the buildup of plaque in arteries. We want to create a nanoparticle that mimics the body’s good cholesterol, known as HDL, which helps to shrink plaque.</p>  <!-- change this -->

      <p>
        We are the leading company in using nanotechnology in humans to eradicate diseases. We have been working to bring the best and most affordable technology. 
        We believe that no one should have to suffer because of illness. People suffer and die every day to simple diseases and parasites and we want to reduce that number to no one. 
        We are hoping to bring this technology to third world countries and treat those less fortunate to better health. While we know this is a huge undertaking, we believe that life is worth saving no matter who they are.

      <h3>NanoTech</h3>
      <p>
        Nanoscience and nanotechnology involve the ability to see and to control individual atoms and molecules. Everything on Earth is made up of atoms—the food we eat, the clothes we wear, the buildings and houses we live in, and our own bodies.
        But something as small as an atom is impossible to see with the naked eye. In fact, it’s impossible to see with the microscopes typically used in a high school science classes.
        Nanotechnology is already broadening the medical tools, knowledge, and therapies currently available to clinicians. Nanomedicine, the application of nanotechnology in medicine, 
        draws on the natural scale of biological phenomena to produce precise solutions for disease prevention, diagnosis, and treatment.

      </ul>
      <h3>Q&A</h3>
      <p>
        Common Questions that are asked of us are; is what your doing possible? Is this safe? Is this ethical? And some answers to these hard questions are; 
        Yes, this is very possible, only a short time ago we were able to drop nanotech into oils spills to contain and eat the oil thus saving the marine life. 
        If we set the parameters of the machines to eat specific formations of atoms or specific chemical makeups, we could stop cancer or even the common cold. 
        Yes, it is safe we have tested extensively on test animals with zero problems and are now in the midst of human trials through volunteers. 
        We have been able to get rid of cancer cells that were growing and even myxomatosis in rabbits. The simple answer to is it ethical is yes. 
        We believe in upholding morals and values as a company and that is why even though we used testing animals to test the technology we believed that this was the only possibility to bring us the ability to stop horrendous diseases in humans.
         None of the test subjects that were used would have survived if left untreated.

        From top to bottom the wireframe has a header with a logo to the left is the navigation links. Below the header 
        are images behind text. Here I want to add information about nanotech and provide information about them with pictures of concept art 
        below is the footer with the relevant information and social media links to the right.

      <h3>Q&A</h3>
      <p>         
        From top to bottom the wireframe has a header with a logo of the company, to the right and navigation links next to it going to the 
        right of the page. there are 3 pictures that are on the left side of the page with text to the right of them. 
        I want to add relivent pictures to the questions that will be added here. At the bottom we have the footer and to the right we have links to all socials.
